### Hey everyone!

My name is Michael Gulotta, welcome to my GitHub profile! 

After working for nearly 10 years in Customer Support I decided to make an exciting career pivot into the world of WebDevelopment. 
Currently I am enrolled in BloomTech's Full-Stack Web Development program and I expect to finish up in September 2023. 

I've pinned some of the projects I've worked on over the past few months that I think were either interesting or challenging for me to complete.

The amount I have learned in this short time is immense but I still have a long way to go!

Looking forward to see what new projects arise and where this journey will take me. 

If you're viewing this page and would like to get in contact with me, please feel free to shoot me a message through LinkedIn. 
My page is linked to this GitHub profile.

Other than coding, my interests include Video Games, Tv / Films, and all things Comedy!

That's about it for now, have a great day!

-- Mike Gulotta
